# 📊 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
Used a resume dataset containing resume text and job role labels.
2. Data Preprocessing
Converted text into lowercase
Removed extra spaces
Removed duplicate resumes
Cleaned and standardized job roles
3. Feature Engineering
Applied TF-IDF Vectorization
Used bigrams for better text understanding
4. Model Building

Trained multiple machine learning models:

Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Linear SVM
XGBoost
5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using Macro F1 Score
Compared model performance
Selected the best-performing model
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Tuned Linear SVM parameters
Improved model performance using cross-validation
7. Deployment
Saved trained models using .pkl files
Built frontend using Streamlit
Deployed as a web application
